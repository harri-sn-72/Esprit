Built this mental health app for the 2023 Congressional App Challenge and met Rep. Deborah K. Ross. This app uses CoreML, the OpenAI ChatGPT API that has been restricted to provide simple, non-medical assistance on mental health matters, and lastly integration with smart devices such as Apple Watch with the HealthKit framework. This app also combined AudioKit and VideoKit to provide users meditation visuals.
